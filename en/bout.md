## Start, stop and progress of the match
1. The first fencer called takes his place at the right hand of the chief referee.
2. After the chief referee calls "On your guard!" both fencers take their basic positions, each on mark 2 m from the centre of the board.
3. The head judge then asks the question "Ready?" and if so or if there is no negative answer, the chief referee will start the clash with the instruction "Forward!".
4. The fencers must wait without moving for the signal "Forward!".
5. The chief referee stops the clash with the word and gesture "Stop!" or "Halt!", the assistant referee may stop the clash only in case of imminent danger.
6. Fencers are obliged to signal "Stop!" or "Halt!" to stop fencing and stand on the current position.
7. Offensive action after "Stop" is penalized with a yellow card.
8. Reasons for stopping are:
   1. a valid hit by at least one fencer
   2. an invalid hit that would complicate the subsequent assessment of the clash
   3. leaving the planche with both feet; for leaving the planche with the fencer's own movement, the penalty is
      yellow card; if a fencer is physically pushed off the field by an opponent, no penalty is awarded
   4. expiry of the time limit
   5. danger due to equipment failure or other health-threatening circumstances
   6. lack of clarity of the situation which does not allow a regular assessment of the clash
   7. a request for a stop by the fencer, signalled by a raising a hand.
9. the fencer is obliged to appear on the battlefield within 1 minute of the announcement of the match. Otherwise the referee may issue a yellow card for stalling.
10. The hitting area is divided into deep and shallow targets. Shallow targets are legs from the knees (inclusive).
    downwards and arms from the elbows (inclusive) onwards. Deep targets are the torso, head, arms from the elbow up and legs
    from the knee up.

### Match length
1. The time of the match is given by the net fencing time, i.e. the stopwatch is started by the instruction "Forward!"
   and stopped by the instruction "Stop!" or "Halt!".
2. The stopwatch that measures time may be visible to both fencers or the referee/timer
   must inform the fencer of the time of the match following his/her polite enquiry.
3. Matches in the group phase shall last 3 minutes net time or if one of the fencers
   does not reach 8 points.
4. Matches in the elimination phase last 5 minutes of net time or until one of the fencers scores 11
   points.
5. If the time allotted for a match expires and the result is a tie, the fencers,
   who made the first clean hit in the match is awarded the "advantage" and the match is reset for 1 minute.
   The match is stopped if:
   1. a clean hit is achieved
   2. there is a tie in which two unequal targets are hit. The fencer who hits the deep target wins.
   3. no hit occurs in one minute -> the fencer with the "advantage" wins.
7. the fencer may request a time out for demonstrable medical reasons. However, if
   he is unable to continue the match within 3 minutes, he will receive a black card.

## Refereeing
Each match is controlled and scored by one head referee. The number of secondary referees is not
limited, usually one for the group stage and up to three for the elimination stage of the tournament. Neither the main nor
minor referees cannot be video referees at the same time.

### Main referee
1. Controls the group phase in his/her group.
2. Controls the individual matches.
3. Is responsible for checking the equipment before his/her matches.
4. Directs his/her assigned sub referees, timekeeping and score keeping.
5. Moves around the field in such a way as to keep perfect track of the action on the field.
6. He awards penalties (yellow, red and black cards).

   point, card or suspend the match.

### Sub-judge
1. Acts as an assistant to the head referee in matters of interference. His task is to observe
   the match from other angles and to remember the hits he sees.
2. If the assistant observes that a fencer he is watching has been hit, he raises his hand. On this.
   the head referee may or may not stop the match.
3. The assistant is not responsible for assigning hits.

## Scoring
1. The engagement area is divided into deep and shallow targets. Shallow is legs from the knees (inclusive)
   down and arms from the elbows (inclusive) onwards. Deep targets are the torso, head, arms from the elbow up and legs
   from the knee up.
2. A clean hit on a shallow target is worth 1 point.
3. A clean hit on a deep target is worth 2 points.
4. In the event that both shallow and deep targets are hit in one attack, the attack action is scored
   as a deep target hit.
5. A simultaneous hit is scored based on which target was hit.
   Example.
   of fencer A is scored as 2 points for fencer A and 1 point for fencer B. Souzasah
   is a situation where the fencers hit each other at a pace that is possible
   to be considered simultaneous.
6. The referee may award a point for an action only if that action began between the signals "Forward!" and "Halt!"
   or "Stop!".
7. After the clash has stopped, the head referee reviews and analyses the actions of the last exchange. Subsequently
   evaluates whether a point will be awarded to one fencer, both or neither. Referee
   must be able to describe verbally the last action on the basis of which he awards points. He must be able to
   explain to the fencers what actions and hits he has observed.
8. The referee must not award a point if he does not know what he has seen, is not sure of the time sequence or
   the location of the hit. The referee has the right to illuminate the action by previewing the video.

      are not considered valid. Only a flat blade strike to the head is valid.

    but must give sufficient reasons for his decision.

### Domination by disarmament
A point is awarded to a fencer even on the basis of an action in which there was no hit, but the fencer disarmed
